# 3D_PrimaryCellCulture_Methods
Custom designs of 3D printed and machined parts for use in 3D in vitro primary cell culture

These files should be used to create the stainless steel injection mold piece (.SLDPRT and .SLDDRW) and the injection mold PLA-lift piece (.f3d). 

## Software
1. AutoDesk Fusion360 - commercial computer-aided design software for prefabrication design of PLA-lift piece
2. PrusaSlicer - open source tool to convert 3D model into print instructions for 3D printer (Prusa i3mk3)
3. Solidworks - commercial computer-aided design software for prefabrication design of stainless steel injectio mold piece
